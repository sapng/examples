h2. Mapping RDF to Neo4j

RDF triple consist of subject, predicate and object. 
* Subjects in rdf triples are URIs or blank nodes.
* All predicates are URIs.
* Objects can be URIs, blank nodes or literal values. 

When mapping RDF to Neo4j following points are taken in considertaion:
* Each neo4j node has a label that is either *uri* , *literal* or *bnode*.
* Nodes having label *uri* or *bnode* have one property 
** uri
* Nodes having label *literal* have three properties
** value 
** datatype
** lang

Follwing figure demostrats how uri and literals are modeled in Neo4j.

h3. Example 1

The following RDF statment is taken from RDF primer. This RDF statement have: 
* a subject http://www.example.org/index.html
* a predicate http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/creator
* and an object http://www.example.org/staffid/85740

The subject and object are resources so while mapping them neo4j node has label *uri*.The following figure shows how this statement is represented in Neo4j. (In mapping prefixes are used)

h3. Example 2

Following figure have multiple statements about the same subject. The object can be a URI or literal value.

Subjects and objects when mapped in neo4j node have label *uri* while literal values have label *literal*. The properties of *uri* and *literals* are different.

h3. Example 3

This RDF statement has:
* a subject http://www.example.org/staffid/85740
* a predicate http://example.org/terms/age
* and an object "27" which is a literal value.

The subject is a resource so while mapping them neo4j node has label *uri*.Literal values can have their datatype and language as well.

h3. Example 4

Subject and object can also be a blank node (a resource having no URI)

!http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/REC-rdf-primer-20040210/fig13dec16.png!

While mapping blank node the neo4j node has label *bnode*.
