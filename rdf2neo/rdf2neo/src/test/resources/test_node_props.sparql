# An example of how to return pairs of name/value that represent the properties of a Cypher node.
# 
# - ?name is typically a IRI and is converted into a shorter ID by means of a configured IRI->ID converter.
# - ?value is a literal and, for the moment, is converted into a string, using its lexical value. We'll offer
# more customisation soon (e.g., mapping XSD types to Cypher/Java types).
# - ?iri is bound to a specific node IRI, to get the properties for that node. 
# 
SELECT DISTINCT ?name ?value
{
	?iri a ?label.
	FILTER ( ?label != ex:Relation ).

	?iri ?name ?value.
	FILTER ( isLiteral ( ?value ) ).
}
